* Social Media Advertisements are quite popular however:  
   
   * Paying ads on social media can be quite expensive and the click may not always lead to sales.
   * Celebrity endorsements can often lead to more sales than random ad clicks but the marketing cost is still relatively high.

This project introduces an IMG2RECOMMENDER concept for more targeted social media advertisement. This approach uses deep learning to convert social media images to more targeted product advertisements.
