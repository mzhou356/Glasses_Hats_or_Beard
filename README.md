* Social Media Advertisements are quite popular however:  
   
   * Paying ads on social media can be quite expensive and the click may not always lead to sales.
   * Celebrity endorsements can often lead to more sales than random ad clicks but the marketing cost is still relatively high.

This project introduces an IMG2RECOMMENDER concept for more targeted social media advertisement. This approach uses deep learning to convert social media images to more targeted product advertisements.

* Project Goals:  

  - Successfully recommend hat, beard, or eyewear (HBE) products to customers in pictures.  
  
  - Develop a prototype program to recommend one of the 3 products to customers. 
  
#### Evaluation Criteria:

* Success Metrics:  

  - Develop successful one vs rest multi-classifiers with high AUC and high F1 scores. 
  
  - Able to recommend sensible products based upon the images seens. 

### Data Understanding

* Image Data of People: 
  
  - Manually scraped from google images 
     * total 653 usable images 
     
  - Manually labelled and cropped images of portraits for transfer learning training. 
  
  - Each image may have 2 or 3 labels. This is a multilabel classification problem. 
     * convert the folders of images into a pandas dataframe:
